Turn based card fighting game featuring deck building from a .txt file  
Battle it out with your guardians and lead them to victory  

For now it just loads a deck using the provided .txt file to which you can keep adding cards via the provided method  
The game itself isn't finished, but it does shuffle the deck, deals the cards and *sets up* a match, but that's it
